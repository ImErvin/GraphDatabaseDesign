# Neo4j Graph Database Design Document
###### By Ervin Mamutov

## The Aim
The aim of this project is to provide a Graph Database design for my college's timetabling system. I will be covering exactly how the timetabling data should be stored and how it will be represented in the graph database. There will also be a sample Neo4j database prototyping my design structure. I will provide a Cypher API explaining how to perform CRUD operations on the sample database.
