# Neo4j Graph Database Design Document
###### By Ervin Mamutov

### The Spec
>You are required to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use
in a timetabling system for a third level institute like GMIT. The database
should store information about student groups, classrooms, lecturers, and
work hours Â– just like the currently used timetabling system at GMIT.

### Graph Databases
#### What are Graph Databases?
**A graph** [1] is composed of two elements, a node and a relationship. A node 
represents an entity and a relationship represents how these entities are associated.

**A database** [2] is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be 
easily accessed, managed and updated.

**A graph database** [2] is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph theory to store, map 
and query relationships. Graph databases are basically collections of nodes and edges, 
where each node represents an entity, and each edge represents a connection between nodes.

Relationships take first priority in Graph Databases. 

#### Why would a Graph Database be useful for a timetabling system?
To understand why a graph database would be useful for a timetabling system, we must
first understand what a timetabling system is.

A timetabling system is a method of organizing student groups and lecturers to provide
an organized schedule for modules, rooms and work times. A timetabling system cares more 
about the relationship between pieces of data rather than the data it's self.

As mentioned above, relationships take first priority in graph databases. This is why
a graph database would really compliment a timetabling system. Using a graph database
to create an effective graph modeled network of nodes and thier relationships, the database
can be efficiently queried for very specific information.

Timetabling schedules are subject to change quite frequently during the start of a 
semester, so the flexibility of graph databases can accommodate to these changes. Data teams 
can add to or update the existing graph structure without endangering current functionality [1].

#### What is Neo4j?
Neo4j is the world's leading graph database.

Neo4j is an open-source NoSQL graph database implemented in Java and Scala. Development started 
in 2003 and has been publicly available since 2007. Since Neo4j is open-source, the source code 
is available on GitHub. Neo4j is used by a large amount of companies and organizations in almost
all industries. Different uses for Neo4j include matchmaking, network management, software analytics, 
scientific research, routing, organizational management and more. [3]

#### How does Neo4j work?
Neo4j, upon installation, provides a server that runs on localhost:7474. This server 
uses JAXRS and Jersey, combined with a Jetty web server [6] to provide a REST based web-service that a user 
can use to interact with or get a visual representation of the graph database by using Neo4j's Cypher query 
language.

Cypher query language, developed by Neo Technology for Neo4j, is used to query the database to perform
CRUD operations. Cypher is based on the property graph model, which in addition to the standard graph elements
of nodes and edges (relationships) adds labels and properties as concepts [4].

Neo4j stores everything in the form of either an edge, a node or an attribute. Each node and edge can have
any number of properties. Both the nodes and edges can be labeled. Labels can be used to narrow searches [5].

#### Cypher Example
Here is an example of how Cypher can be used to query a database. Picture a family tree with hundreds of nodes and edges.
Each node represents a person and each edge represents the relationship between them. This family tree can be represented
as a graph database on Neo4j.

The query below will create a node labeled Person with node name "ervin" and set's a key-value property pair of key (name) 
and value (Ervin Mamutov).
```Cypher
CREATE (ervin:Person {name:"Ervin Mamutov"})
```
Now we have a node named ervin. Let's create another node named steven and create a relationship between ervin and steven.
This query will create another node labeled Person and create a relationship labeled FAMILY, with a key-value property pair of 
key (relation) and value (Uncle), between the two nodes.
```Cypher
CREATE (steven:Person {name:"Steven Mamutov"})
CREATE (steven)-[:FAMILY {relation:"Uncle"}]->(ervin)
```
Now we have two different nodes connected via family relationship. We can use Cyper to query this family tree. The query below will search through the family tree and return all of Ervin Mamutov's uncles. This is achieved by comparing property value's to the query
specified values after the WHERE clause.
```Cypher
MATCH (a:Person)-[r:FAMILY]->(b:Person)
WHERE b.name = "Ervin Mamutov" and r.relation = "Uncle"
RETURN a,b,r;
```
